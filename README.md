# Data Analysis of XYZ Supermarket

Analysis of the Sales at XYZ Supermarket using pandas analytics

# Project Steps

- Loading of Dataset from the supermarket branches across the country
- Manipulation and Exploration of Dataset using pandas
- Manipulation of DataTime Features from the raw dates to a DateTime Function.
- Extraction secific days, months, year, hours and weekdays for easy analysis.
- Extraction of Unique values of data from the pool of raw data
- Aggregation of Data
- Data Visualization using seaborn

# Insights

From the analysis, we have been able to gain some insight on the sales at the supermarket
- The Lagos Branch of the Supermarket makes the most sales of the three
- The Epay payment channel is the most frequently used of the three methods with Card payment being the least. 
- Furthermore, while the Epay is mostly used, it is the less used in Branch C of the Supermarket which uses Cash the most.
- Likewise, the Cash payment is mostly used for Electronic accessories while the Home & Lifestyle products as well as Fashion accessories use the Epay channel the most.
- Fashion accessories is the product line with the highest sales recorded while the Health and beauty products sell the least.
- Furthermore, the average sales recorded for Fashion accessories appear to be the least and also the highest average unit price while the electronic accessories seem to perform in the opposite direction.
- Branch A has the least rating.
- Generally, the females appear to make more purchases than the males except for health where the males appear to make higher purchases.
- Subsequently, the females also appear to make higher purchases of food and beverages while the spots and travel appears to be quite uniform
- we can also infer that the highest sales were recorded on Saturdays with the least recorded on Mondays.

# Future Work

In the coming days, I would like to explore how the recommendations implemented from this data has improved sales across the branches of the supermarket  especially in influencing sales of the least performing product lines as well as on days with the least sales.

# Standout Section

Apart from the instructions in the starter notebook, I was able to:
- use the Datetime function to create a seperate weekday column and the unique values were then used in countplot to evaluate the sales performance on different days of the week.
- I was able to use dropcolumn and range commands to remove some stray columns in my data.
